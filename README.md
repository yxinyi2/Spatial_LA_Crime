# Spatial Analysis of Los Angeles Crime

Crime is usually an important factor that affects the quality of life and the development of the city. Crime
analysis allows law enforcement agencies to get a better understanding of the patterns of crimes and
enables them to allocate their resources more efficiently. For this study, we aimed to explore the
distributions of age and gender of victims and the rate of each crime in Los Angeles(LA) in 2017, and
assess the level of spatial clustering for a specific type of crime. In addition, we also identified the most
likely crime districts and provided the related visualizations. The dataset used in this project is provided
by the Los Angeles Police Department, and the cleaned version can be found on Kaggle.
